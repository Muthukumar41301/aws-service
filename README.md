### Why Use Stored Procedures and Functions?

Complex Logic: If you have complicated SQL operations ‚Äî like multiple joins or conditional logic ‚Äî stored procedures can help organize your code.

Performance: Stored procedures sometimes run faster because the database can optimize and cache them.

Security: You can permit to run a stored procedure without allowing direct access to the underlying tables.

Reusability: If many applications or parts of your code need the same SQL logic, you can store it in a procedure or function and call it whenever you want

# üîÅ Transaction Propagation in Spring Boot

## üìò Overview

**Transaction Propagation** defines how transactional methods behave when called within an existing transaction. It controls whether a method joins an existing transaction or starts a new one.

---

## üß© Propagation Types in Spring

| Propagation Type     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `REQUIRED`           | Joins the current transaction if it exists; creates a new one otherwise. **(Default)** |
| `REQUIRES_NEW`       | Suspends the current transaction and always starts a new one.               |
| `NESTED`             | Executes within a nested transaction using savepoints (requires JDBC support). |
| `SUPPORTS`           | Joins the current transaction if it exists; otherwise runs non-transactionally. |
| `NOT_SUPPORTED`      | Always runs non-transactionally, suspending any existing transaction.       |
| `NEVER`              | Must run outside of a transaction. Throws exception if a transaction exists. |
| `MANDATORY`          | Must run inside an existing transaction. Throws exception if none exists.   |

---

## ‚úÖ Usage Example

```java
@Service
public class PaymentService {

    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED)
    public void processPayment() {
        // Joins or starts a transaction
    }

    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
    public void updateAuditLog() {
        // Always runs in a new transaction
    }
}
```

# üîí Transaction Isolation in Spring Boot

## üìò What is Transaction Isolation?

**Transaction Isolation** defines the level of visibility a transaction has to the changes made by other concurrent transactions. It is crucial for ensuring **data consistency and correctness** in multi-user environments, especially in systems that run multiple transactions at the same time.

In Spring Boot, you can set the isolation level using the `@Transactional` annotation:

```java
@Transactional(isolation = Isolation.READ_COMMITTED)
public void execute() {
    // business logic
}
```

## üß™ Isolation Levels Comparison

| Isolation Level       | Type         | Level Rank   | Description                                                                  | Prevents Anomalies                        | Common Use Case                              |
|------------------------|--------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `READ_UNCOMMITTED`     | Read          | üü• Lowest     | Allows reading uncommitted changes (dirty reads).                            | ‚ùå None                                     | High-performance analytics, cache warm-up     |
| `READ_COMMITTED`       | Read          | üü® Low        | Only committed data is visible; dirty reads are prevented.                   | ‚úÖ Dirty Reads                              | Product listings, user profile reads          |
| `REPEATABLE_READ`      | Read          | üüß Medium     | Prevents updates to rows read during the transaction.                        | ‚úÖ Dirty Reads, ‚úÖ Non-repeatable Reads     | Bank balances, order validation               |
| `SERIALIZABLE`         | Read/Write    | üü© Highest    | Full isolation; transactions behave as if run sequentially.                  | ‚úÖ Dirty, ‚úÖ Non-repeatable, ‚úÖ Phantom     | Ticket booking, inventory stock consistency   |
| `DEFAULT`              | DB-dependent  | ‚ÑπÔ∏è Varies     | Uses the database engine‚Äôs default isolation level.                          | ‚ÑπÔ∏è Depends on DB                            | When isolation is not explicitly defined      |
